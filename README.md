# JSON-formatted TLD information

This repository contains scripts to download TLD information hosted on iana.org
and convert it into JSON. Unfortunately, for some reason this information
doesn't appear to be available in machine-readable form.

You can download the final JSON file at
[https://hlandau.github.io/tldinfo/tlds.json](https://hlandau.github.io/tldinfo/tlds.json) ([.gz](https://hlandau.github.io/tldinfo/tlds.json.gz)).

Alternatively, the file can be loaded via a CDN: [https://cdn.rawgit.com/hlandau/tldinfo/gh-pages/tlds.json](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hlandau/tldinfo/gh-pages/tlds.json) ([.gz](https://cdn.rawgit.com/hlandau/tldinfo/gh-pages/tlds.json.gz)).

To build yourself, clone the repository and run `make`.
